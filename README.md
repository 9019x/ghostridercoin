# GhostRider Coin (GRR)

First Release: v1.3

## No Smartnode

GRCoin does not have a Smartnode system. We emphasize simplicity and efficiency.

## Dev Fee

The developer fee is 1% - very small, ensuring that the majority of rewards go to the users.

## Block Time

The block creation time for GRCoin is 90 seconds. Every 20,000 blocks, the block reward will be halved, approximately every 21 days.

## Total Supply

The total supply of GRCoin is fixed at 2,000,000 GRR, with 21 GRR per block. There is no possibility of creating more, ensuring scarcity and value.

## No Website, Explorer, Social Media

Currently, GRCoin does not have an official website, explorer tool, or social media channels like X or Discord. We encourage the community to create and develop these platforms. You can be a pioneer in building the GRCoin community.

## All for Miners

All rewards from GRCoin belong to the miners. There are no other incentives or privileges.

## Your Decision

With GRCoin, you have full control over how to use and develop it. This is a completely open project, relying on your creativity.

## Mining Algorithm

Similar to Bitcoin, GRCoin utilizes the GR algorithm and harnesses the power of the CPU to mine coins. This means that any device with a CPU can mine GRCoin without needing to share resources, except for the 1% developer fee.
